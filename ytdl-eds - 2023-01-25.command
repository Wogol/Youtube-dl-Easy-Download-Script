    # Script Name: Youtube-dl Easy Download Script
    # Description: Easy to use script to download YouTube videos with a couple of
    #              options.
    #
    # What this script do:
    #   - Downloads video in MP4 with highest quality and max resolution 1920x1080.
    #   - Downloads thumbnail, subtitles and json data file.
    #   - Gives user directory option where to save the data.
    #   - Creates a folder with same name as video title and puts all files there.
    #   - Creates a .txt file with information about the video.
    #

    #
    #
    # I created this script because I can't find any download software where the
    # user easy can choose what quality and where to save the data with easy fast
    # keyboard pressed. My hope is that software developers implement these
    # features in their software.
    # 
    # Big thanks to the people at youtube-dl GitHub and Stack Overflow. Without
    # their help this would never ever been possible for me.
	# 
	# With 2023-01-25 version I experimented with ChatGPT and it helped with making
	# the script shorter and easier to understand. Thanks to ChatGPT!
    #
    # #####
    #
    # Software required:                 yt-dlp, ffmpeg, jq, printf
    #
    # macOS:       1. Install Homebrew:  https://brew.sh
    #              2. Terminal command:  brew install yt-dlp jq ffmpeg
    #
    #              Copy this code to TextEdit and save it as a .command file.
    #              Then run terminal command on the file:
    #                                    chmod 744 FILENAME.command
    #
    #              Now you have a .command file that you can click on in macOS.
    #
    #
    # Linux:       Depends on package manager your distribution use.
    #
    # #####
    #
    # Version history:
	# 2023-01-25

	#   - Fixed the issue with _ in directory and file names.
	#
    # 2021-12-11
    #   - Replaced youtube-dl with yt-dlp.
    #   - Bad youtube-dl fix: Changed to all small files downloaded before video
    #     if the download stops, or to slow and stops and download it with another
    #     program instead.
    #
    # 2021-01-10
    #   - Replaced xidel, that has been blocked in Homebrew, with jq.
    #   - Added -â€”write-info-json so json file also gets downloaded.
    #   - Added ffmpeg in required software because youtube-dl use it to
    #     merge files.
    #   - Other minor changes.
    #
    # 2020-09-22
    #   - Select menus is now one column.

    #
    # 2020-09-05
    #   - First working version.
    #
    # #####
    #
    # Issues left:
    #   - Running information file creation in background of media download.
	#     Had problems get it working. It's a very minor issue, so I will ignore it.
