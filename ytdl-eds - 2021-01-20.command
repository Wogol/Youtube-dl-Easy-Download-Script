    #
    #
    # I created this script because I can't find any download software where the
    # user easy can choose what quality and where to save the data with easy fast
    # keyboard pressed. My hope is that software developers implement these
    # features in their software.
    # 
    # Big thanks to the people at youtube-dl GitHub and Stack Overflow. Without
    # their help this would never ever been possible for me.
    #
    # #####
    #
    # Software required:                 youtube-dl, ffmpeg, jq, printf
    #
    # macOS:       1. Install Homebrew:  https://brew.sh
    #              2. Terminal command:  brew install youtube-dl jq ffmpeg
    #
    #              Copy this code to TextEdit and save it as a .command file.
    #              Then run terminal command on the file:
    #                                    chmod 744 FILENAME.command
    #
    #              Now you have a .command file that you can click on in macOS.
    #
    #
    # Linux:       Depends on package manager your distribution use.
    #
    # #####
    #
    # Version history:
    # 2021-01-10
    #   - Replaced xidel, that has been blocked in Homebrew, with jq.
    #   - Added -â€”write-info-json so json file also gets downloaded.
    #   - Added ffmpeg in required software because youtube-dl use it to
    #     merge files.
    #   - Other minor changes.
    #
    # 2020-09-22
    #   - Select menus is now one column.
    #   - Minor fixes.
    #   - Now all the bugs is fixed. Issues left is only optimizations.
    #
    # 2020-09-17
    #   - Folders can now have spaces in them.
    #
    # 2020-09-05
    #   - First working version.
    #
    # #####
    #
    # Issues left:
    #   - Running information file creation in background of media download.
    #
    #   - Script creates underscore _ instead of spaces in directories and
    #     file names youtube-dl creates.
